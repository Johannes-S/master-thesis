# General Information / Results:

- Can we modify the undecidability proof for HRGs?
  - Doesn't look very promising. 
          Reason: We need to start with a fully extended graph
          Two things need to be validated: Graph is based on possible PCP solution and the PCP solution is correct.
          Both properties can only be varified independent from each other. This makes it impossible to know which unique graph this should result in.
