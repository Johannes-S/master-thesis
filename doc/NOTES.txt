# TODO:

## THEORETICAL RESEARCH:

- Rewrite definitions of confluence paper to better fit our HRGs

- Find out if proof of undecidability can be applied for our HRGs
  - Idea: Use a large set of non terminals (powerset of PCP Alphabet with bounded length)

- Find out if counterexample (why simple joinability of critical pairs is not enough) can be modified to fit our HRGs

## PROGRAMMING:

- Implement critical pair generation algorithm

## THESIS WRITING:

- Work on table of contents:


# General Information / Results:

- Can we modify the undecidability proof for HRGs?
  - Doesn't look very promising. 
          Reason: We need to start with a fully extended graph
          Two things need to be validated: Graph is based on possible PCP solution and the PCP solution is correct.
          Both properties can only be varified independent from each other. This makes it impossible to know which unique graph this should result in.
