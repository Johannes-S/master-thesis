## THEORETICAL RESEARCH:

- Rewrite definitions of confluence paper to better fit our HRGs

- Find out if proof of undecidability can be applied for our HRGs
- Find out if counterexample (why simple joinability of critical pairs is not enough) can be modified to fit our HRGs

## PROGRAMMING:

- Implement critical pair generation algorithm

## THESIS WRITING:

- Work on table of contents:
